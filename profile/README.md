## Hi there 👋

Welcome to PKUAutomate! During the COVID-19 pandemic, I use this suite of tools to help my gf automate reporting to get out of Peking University campus. And also enable a remote synchronized movie watching with her. Our mission is to make life easier and more enjoyable through automation and innovation.
